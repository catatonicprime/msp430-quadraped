# The Project 
A long time ago I 3d printed a few parts for a quadraped. I never finished the project.

Until now... if now is sometime in the future. I mean let's finish it!

# Things we probably need to do
1. Create a repo to track the work
1. Build a development environment
1. Write some code (tm)
1. Test that code
1. Design new boards? Maybe?
1. Move the code to the final boards
